It contains different modules that provide visual understanding of raw data from Demographic data, pertaining to eﬀectiveness of public health programmers, demographics related any particular disease. In this application, we have implemented cartograms/maps, temporal chart and bar charts to analyze the impact of different factors related to patient record. This data can be analyzed in the context of the meta-data of the Demograhic data (patient heath record), namely, age, type of disease, gender, patient geo-location. This tool is intended for doctors, hospitals, public health professionals, and others who perform research on these data. The effectiveness of this tool is tested by exploring and analyzing Patient health data of one of the internationally supported public health programs, deployed in India. The tool is generic and can be used with multivariate data from domains such as health, education, environment and others, where there could be additional geospatio-temporal location.
